# My very first website

Welcome! [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

This website was built as part of the learning material for Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer program.

You can check out the website [here](https://aaroncistudent.github.io/my-first-website/stream-two.html)!

[Project Description](https://github.com/Michael-Lusk-2023/cli/blob/main/README.md)

This site was created in order to get familiar with common development tools like Cloud9, Git and GitHub, and how to use them to write and manage code. The project itself will display a breakdown of the different technologies used in each of the different sections of the program.

[Technologies Used](https://github.com/Michael-Lusk-2023/cli/blob/main/README.md)

This project was written in HTML and CSS using Cloud9 and is currently hosted on GitHub pages.
